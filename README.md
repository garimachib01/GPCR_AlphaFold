# GPCR_AlphaFold

This repository provides the implementation of the paper - "**Characterizing the Conformational States of G Protein Coupled Receptors Generated with AlphaFold**". 
This project conducts an evaluation of AlphaFoldâ€™s performance in predicting GPCR structures and their conformational states by comparing its predictions to experimentally determined structures. 

The data for the ground truth GPCRs can be found here - [TM Only Final Data](https://github.com/garimachib01/GPCR_AlphaFold/tree/main/Data/TM_only_final)

Data for AlphaFold 2 generated structures can be found here - [AlphaFold 2 Data](https://github.com/garimachib01/GPCR_AlphaFold/tree/main/Data/AF2_Aligned)

Data for AlphaFold 3 generated structures can be found here - [AlphaFold 3 Data](https://github.com/garimachib01/GPCR_AlphaFold/tree/main/Data/AF3_aligned)
