# GPCR_AlphaFold

This repository provides the implementation of the paper - "**Characterizing the Conformational States of G Protein Coupled Receptors Generated with AlphaFold**". 
This project conducts an evaluation of AlphaFoldâ€™s performance in predicting GPCR structures and their conformational states by comparing its predictions to experimentally determined structures. 

The data for the ground truth GPCRs can be found here - [TM Only Final Data](https://github.com/garimachib01/GPCR_AlphaFold/tree/main/Data/TM_only_final)

Data for AlphaFold 2 generated structures can be found here - [AlphaFold 2 Data](https://github.com/garimachib01/GPCR_AlphaFold/tree/main/Data/AF2_Aligned)

Data for AlphaFold 3 generated structures can be found here - [AlphaFold 3 Data](https://github.com/garimachib01/GPCR_AlphaFold/tree/main/Data/AF3_aligned)

To reproduce results, clone this GitHub repository and install the following packages in Python: 

`pip install biopython`

 `pip install mdtraj`
 


## Evaluating AlphaFold predictions
- ### Average Deformation
  `calculating_deformation.ipynb` contains details on how to calculate the average distance between alpha-carbon atoms of reference and AlphaFold generated structures.
  Change file paths to get deformations for AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold 3 accordingly
- ### Helix 3 - Helix 6 Distance
  `h3_h6.ipynb` contains the code to calculate the H3-H6 distance, an important metric that is correlated with the activity level of GPCRs. Calculating the difference between the H3-H6 distance in reference and generated structures can give us an indication of AlphaFold's predictive accuracy. Change file paths for AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold 3 accordingly.

- Additionally, `calculate_overlapping_sequence_ratio.ipynb` shows an example of how to calculate the ratio of sequence overlap between the reference and AlphaFold 2 generated structures.

## Results
The [Results](https://github.com/garimachib01/GPCR_AlphaFold/tree/main/Results) folder contains the average deformation and the H3-H6 distances. The final results for AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold 3 can be found in `deform_h3_h6_results_AF2.csv ` `and deform_h3_h6_results_AF3.csv` respectively.

## Plots
Refer to `plots.ipynb` for details on the plots provided in the paper. Change file paths for AlphaFold 2 and AlphaFold 3 accordingly.
